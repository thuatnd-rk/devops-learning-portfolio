# GitOps Principles

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### **What is GitOps?**
GitOps is a methodology for managing infrastructure and application deployments using Git as the single source of truth. It combines version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD tooling to automate the delivery of applications and infrastructure.

### **Core Principles**
1. **Declarative**: All system state is declared in a declarative format
2. **Versioned and Immutable**: Desired state is versioned in Git
3. **Pulled Automatically**: Software agents automatically pull the desired state
4. **Continuously Reconciled**: Software agents continuously observe actual state and attempt to apply the desired state
